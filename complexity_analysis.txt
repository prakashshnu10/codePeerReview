Code Complexity Analysis:
File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\app.controller.ts
Complexity Level: low
Details: The code consists of a simple NestJS controller with a single endpoint that calls a service method. There are no complex control flow or nested structures, making it low in complexity.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\app.module.ts
Complexity Level: high
Details: The code imports and initializes multiple modules, setting up complex dependencies and configurations. The code structure is tightly coupled, making it challenging to test and maintain. It also requires careful management of environment variables and external services.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\app.service.ts
Complexity Level: low
Details: The code is a simple NestJS service with a single method 'getHello' that returns the string 'Hello World!'. There are no nested loops, conditional branches, or other complex structures.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\main.ts
Complexity Level: low
Details: The code is straightforward and has a low level of complexity. It primarily consists of initialization and configuration of a Nest.js application with a simple CORS setup and listening to a port.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\web3-service\web3-service.module.ts
Complexity Level: low
Details: The code consists of module and service/controller imports, module imports, and providers/controllers definitions. There are no complex control flows or nested logic found.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\web3-service\controller\web3-service-with-apiversioning.controller.ts
Complexity Level: medium
Details: The code has multiple asynchronous operations and error handling, which can lead to complexity in understanding and maintaining the code. The presence of validation and exception handling logic adds to the overall complexity.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\web3-service\controller\web3-service.controller.ts
Complexity Level: high
Details: The code contains multiple asynchronous functions, error handling, validation, and conditional logic. There are also multiple endpoints and use of external services. The complexity arises from the combination of these factors, leading to high cognitive load and potential difficulty in maintenance and debugging.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\web3-service\controller\web3-service_with-swagger.ts
Complexity Level: low
Details: The code is relatively straightforward with minimal complexity. It sets up a simple Express application with Swagger documentation and a single example route. There are no complex nested loops or conditional structures.

File: src/IBBA_Rewards_Backend/src\web3-service\service\web3-service.service.ts
Complexity Level: high
Details: The code exhibits a high complexity level due to the presence of multiple asynchronous operations, interactions with smart contracts, database queries, file system operations, extensive error handling, and complex business logic within the functions. It also involves complex event tracking, transaction signing, and balancing checks.
